### Tips:
- Tap the `mode` button twice to turn the red lamp on.  
- Tap the `power` button twice to turn the low lamp on.  
- Press and hold the power button for a few seconds to turn it off.  
- Press and hold both buttons for 5 seconds to enter or exit lockout mode.  
- When in lockout mode, the light works as a signalling light as any press on any button triggers a brief flash.
