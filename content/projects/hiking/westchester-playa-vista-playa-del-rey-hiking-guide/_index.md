## Great hiking near LAX



This part of Los Angeles has a lot of surprisingly remote feeling hikes. Located just north of LAX these three neighborhoods have a beach, the second largest open space in Los Angeles ([ballona wetlands]({{< relref "ballona-wetlands" >}})), and a bluff side hiking trail with expansive city, mountain and ocean views.
