Ballona contains a complex mosaic of habitats defined mainly by hydrology, including wetland habitats, such as brackish and freshwater marshes, seasonally flooded freshwater wetlands, salt pans, riparian and upland habitats, like coastal sage scrub and sand dunes. Many wildlife species, especially birds, utilize more than one habitat type â€“ thus the juxtaposition of these habitats next to one another, also known as heterogeneity, which is important for biodiversity.

This area is mostly a protected ecological preserve and not accessible, but there are some nice trails along lincoln and jefferson that let's you get a peek at the wetlands.
