## AKA LMU Trail, AKA Westchester fireroad trail.

The Bluff Creek trail is a nice mostly flat partially paved/dirt path that traverses the bluff just under LMU. Recommended as a loop with a couple mile trail and then couple miles walking in Playa Vista through Oberrieder park.

The Bluff Creek Trail is a 4-mile loop that can be accessed from three locations:

1. **Dunbarton Avenue**: At the end of Dunbarton Avenue in Westchester, where it dead-ends into a cul-de-sac.
2. **Bluff Creek Drive**: Across the street from Yahoo and the Annenberg PetSpace Adoption Center.
3. **Lincoln Boulevard**: Near the fountain, although there is no parking near this entrance. However, you can usually park easily at the Sports Park next to Playa Vista Elementary, just down the hill from the trailhead.

## Trail Options

This trail can be completed in various ways:
- **As a Loop**: Walk along Bluff Creek Drive for half of the loop and then back along the upper trail. This can be started and finished at any point.
- **Out and Back**: From Dunbarton to Lincoln, Dunbarton to Sepulveda, or any combination thereof.

### Restrictions

There is a lower trail that is closed due to the bird migration season. While it had limited access at times in the past, restrictions have recently been increased, and it is not advisable to enter this area.

## Scenic Highlights

This is a classic Southern California trail with diverse scenic views:
- **Snow-Covered Mountains**: Visible on one side.
- **The Ocean**: Visible on the other side.
- **Hollywood Sign**: Can be seen at one point.
- **Mount Wilson and Towers**: Possibly visible with a zoom lens or very good eyesight.
- **Landmarks**: Various parts of Miracle Mile, Santa Monica, Marina del Rey, and even Downtown Los Angeles (though Playa Vista is very close by).

Along the trail, you will pass by notable sites such as:
- The Spruce Goose building of Google headquarters.
- IMAX headquarters.
- Yahoo office.
- Annenberg Pet Space.
- Multiple dog runs: Playa Vista Bluff Creek Dog Run and Oberrieder Dog Run.

Bluff Creek Trail offers a little slice of heaven, located on the border between Westchester and Playa Vista, just below the bluffs of Loyola Marymount University. Whether you're looking for a scenic walk, a neighborhood loop, or a place to enjoy with your furry friends, this trail has something for everyone.
