Oberrieder Dog Park is a large, partially shaded woodchip covered enclosure for dogs and humans to relax and enjoy the company of other dogs (and humans). It is next to a beautiful walking path along the oberreider wetlands with views of the bluffs under LMU. This path easily connects to the [Bluff Creek Trail]({{< relref "/projects/hiking/westchester-playa-vista-playa-del-rey-hiking-guide/bluff-creek-trail" >}}) for the back half of a 4.5 mile loop.
