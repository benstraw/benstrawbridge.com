## Maps, Guides and Logs

One of my greatest joys is being outdoors in a wide open space with nothing made by man in sight. At times, I do have to come back to reality, and occasionally when I do, I will share routes, guides, maps, and from time to time, gear recommendations. 

Join alltrails using this link and they will plant 2 trees after you join.

I will only make recommendations when I genuinely stand behind what I suggest. That being said, I may earn commission from some of these recommendations if you purchase them through a link on this site.

There are 2 types of templates that I am working on for this section, one which is a general hiking trail guide, like all-trails, and the other is a hiker log website which you can paste in your `.gpx` files to generate a log page with a map and other data.
