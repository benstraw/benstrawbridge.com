> Pick a Square, any Square! Only $_n_ a square! Step right up folks and get your lucky square.

This was kind of a challenge from a friend of mine. He wanted squares for an event that was a website - html, not an image, that could be used on a big screen at a venue AND printed out on a poster OR standard paper all in one url, just works for all of those.

### TODO:

- Configuration screen.
- Controller
  - Enter player names
  - Enter scores and highlight winning squares
