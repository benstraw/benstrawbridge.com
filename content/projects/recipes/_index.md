## Recipes I have collected, created or modified over the years. 

I get very frustrated by the recipe websites out there today. The ones that dominate in the search results are usually SEO over-engineered pages with too-long content describing all sorts of different things you really don't care about, with too many confusing ads mixed-in.

This is a search for a solution to easily sharable, open recipe format / protocol / api. The data and recipes here are real, but I am experimenting with the display and the data formatting and it is all bound to change over time, eventually it may become a recipe database website.

You also may want to take a look at my [ingredients]({{% relref "/ingredients" %}}) section to learn about the best quality ingredients to use in your cooking.
