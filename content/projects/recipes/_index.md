Recipes I have collected, created or modified over the years. 

I get very frustrated by the recipe websites out there today. The ones that dominate in the search results are usually SEO over-engineered pages with too-long content describing all sorts of different things you really don't care about, with too many confusing ads mixed-in.

This is a search for a solution to easily sharable, open recipe format / protocol / api ... tbd.

In the meantime, the data I am building here is from my own cooking and will be all real recipes.
