  text = "To prepare the marinade, start by finely mincing four cloves of fresh garlic and setting them aside. In a medium-sized mixing bowl, combine a quarter cup of extra-virgin olive oil with three tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice. Add two tablespoons of balsamic vinegar, a tablespoon of Dijon mustard, and a teaspoon of honey for a touch of sweetness. Stir in the minced garlic, along with a teaspoon each of dried oregano, basil, and thyme. Season generously with freshly ground black pepper and sea salt to taste. Whisk the mixture thoroughly until it emulsifies and the ingredients are well blended. Next, take two boneless, skinless chicken breasts and place them in a resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade over the chicken, seal the bag, and massage it gently to ensure the chicken is evenly coated. Refrigerate for at least two hours, preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to meld and penetrate the meat, resulting in a juicy and flavorful dish ready for grilling or baking."
