Introducing the [Ryder theme](https://www.github.com/arts-link/ryder), a theme for the [hugo static website generator](https://www.gohugo.io).

This is the first hugo theme I have written from scratch, and it has been a lot of fun doing it. My goal for this theme is to include all of the website features I needed for this website, plus a bunch of extras I need for client websites or for other users of this theme.

As this was (is) a learning project for me, I hope this theme will be a starting point for others learning to write their own themes as well. It could be a good boilerplate to build your own custom website around.
