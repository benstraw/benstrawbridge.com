https://www.arts-link.com is the first domain I ever purchased. I believe it was around 2001. It has been various different websites throughout the years, including not a web-site at all. In this rendition it is an organization which is set up to support artists in their technical needs, to free them from the discratction of such things as self-promotion and websites.  

The [github organization](https://www.github.com/arts-link/) is where I will be posting such things as [this theme](https://www.github.com/arts-link/ryder), and other tools. I am also going to build out some services for gallery owners built on top of open-source projects for managing businesses, inventory, offices and more.
