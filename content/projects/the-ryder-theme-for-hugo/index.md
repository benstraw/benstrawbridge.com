![In honor of this old guy](ryder-theme-og.jpg)

Introducing the [Ryder theme](https://www.github.com/arts-link/ryder), a theme for the [hugo static website generator](https://www.gohugo.io). This is an open-source Hugo theme boasting Tailwind CSS, FontAwesome integration, and customizable features. Perfect for beginners and seasoned developers alike, kickstart your website with this versatile theme.

This is the first hugo theme I have written from scratch, and it has been a lot of fun doing it. My goal for this theme is to include all of the website features I needed for this website, plus a bunch of extras I need for client websites or for other users of this theme.

As this was (is) a learning project for me, I hope this theme will be a starting point for others learning to write their own themes as well. It could be a good boilerplate to build your own custom website around.
