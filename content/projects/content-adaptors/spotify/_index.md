## Spotify API feed

{{< font-awesome "fab fa-spotify text-7xl mr-2 text-emerald-500 inline-block align-middle max-w-16 fill-current" >}}  These are some of the recent artists from Spotify. I made a taxonomy of `musical genres` so each genre has a page on this site now which you may explore from the [musical genres page]({{< relref "/musical-genres/" >}}).
