I get very frustrated by the recipe websites out there today. The ones that dominate in the search results are usually SEO over-engineered pages with long content describing all sorts of different things you really don't care about, with plenty of space mixed in for ads.  

I recently discovered the [Open Recipe Format](https://open-recipe-format.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/tutorials/walkthrough.html) and so I decided why not give it a go and see about setting up a template to use for totally clean and uncluttered recipe websites.

<!-- Maybe getting this going with Open Recipe Format will start the open recipe movement! Viva La RecipÃ©! -->
