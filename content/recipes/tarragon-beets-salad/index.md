This was an attempt to copy a salad from [Bristol Farms](https://www.bristolfarms.com/). I ended up modifying it quite a bit from the initial ingredients.

Makes about 4 qts. Lasts for over a week in the fridge.

## Salad Ingredients:
- 5 Beets
- ½ heart of celery
- ½ lg onion
- ¼ cup crushed walnuts
- 1 cup mushrooms
- 1 apple
- 1 tbsp chia seeds
- Salt
- Pepper
- 1 cup Farro

## Dressing Ingredients:
- ¼ cup EVO
- ¼ cup Balsamic Vinegar
- 1 tbsp Spicy mustard
- Fresh Tarragon to taste

## For Beets (can be done the day before):
![Slice em up and cook em on parchment paper](/images/recipes/tarragon-beets-salad/beets-on-parchment.jpg)
- Preheat oven to 425
- Cut (optionally peeled) beets into medium thin slices
- Cut mushrooms into medium pieces. Any mushroom is fine but I like crimini or portobello
- On parchment paper covered baking sheet layout beet slices in single layer and pour some EVO over them and some salt and pepper (too taste, or not)
- Let cool in refrigerator

## For Salad Dressing (can be done the day before):
- In a tupperware with a lid mix all the salad dressing ingredients. Dice the tarragon into smallish pieces, use as much or little as you like, I use about 1 tbsp
- Shake it up before using

## For Salad Preperation:
![Chop up all the veggies nice and small](/images/recipes/tarragon-beets-salad/chopped-veggies.jpg)

- Prepare farro as directed, I use Bob’s Red Mill, and it takes about 1hr, chill by rinsing in cold water or just stick it in the fridge for a bit (this could be done the day before if you do the beets the day before)
- Dice celery, apple and onion into small pieces
- Slice the beets into smaller pieces, but larger than the others
- In a large bowl combine all the ingredients and toss vigorously, adding the dressing slowly as the beets are the main ingredient you don’t want to overpower them
