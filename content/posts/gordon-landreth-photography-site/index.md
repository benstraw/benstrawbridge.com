I built a photo gallery site for my grandfather's photography spanning 1931 to the 1990s.

[Gordon Landreth Photography](https://gordon-landreth-photography.arts-link.com/) is a Hugo-based static site hosting 48 photo albums with over 3,400 scanned pages from my grandfather's collection. The site includes a [search feature](https://gordon-landreth-photography.arts-link.com/search/) that uses OCR to make all the typed captions on the album pages searchable, so you can find photos by name, location, date, or event.
