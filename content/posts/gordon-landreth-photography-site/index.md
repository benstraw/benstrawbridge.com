I've launched [Gordon Landreth Photography](https://gordon-landreth-photography.arts-link.com/), a digital gallery showcasing my grandfather's photography from 1931 through the 1990s. The site contains 48 photo albums with over 3,400 scanned pages.

The most useful feature is the [search interface](https://gordon-landreth-photography.arts-link.com/search/) that lets you find photos by searching the typed captions on each album page. Search for names, places, dates, or events and get instant results with thumbnail previews. No backend required - everything runs client-side using OCR-extracted text and fuzzy matching.

For those interested in the technical implementation, I wrote up a [detailed project writeup](/projects/ocr-powered-search-photo-gallery/) covering the OCR pipeline, search architecture, vision models, and UX decisions.
