- found this blog post over at [osgav.run](https://osgav.run/lab/hugo-leaflet-integration.html) which reminded me of [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/). I had worked on a mapping project years ago and used leaflet for it, but hadn't checked it out since around 2018.
- downloaded leaflet.js from their [downloads page](https://leafletjs.com/download.html)
- copied the extracted zip to the `/static` directory of the ryder theme.
