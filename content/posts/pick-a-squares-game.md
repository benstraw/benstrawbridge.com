I created a pick-a-squares game template, aka the Super Bowl squares. It is still a work in progress, but I hope to have it snazzy in time for next year. [Take a look at the template]({{< ref "/projects/pick-a-square-game/grid-basic/" >}}).

### Project Goals

- Ability to enter people into squares
- Generate random score rows with animated flourish
- Presentation mode for big screen action with controller to enter periodic scores
- Calculate payouts based on price of a square

### Project Timeline

- Launch in time for SB LIX
