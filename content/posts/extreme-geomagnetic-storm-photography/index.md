On [May 10 2024](https://www.spaceweather.com/archive.php?view=1&day=10&month=05&year=2024) the biggest geomagnetic storm in almost 20 years reached category [G5](https://www.spaceweather.com/glossary/g5.jpg)--an extreme event. So I decided it mighht be a fun time to go out do some night photography. There were reports of Aurora sightings as far south as Joshua Tree, so I decided to head out to take a look. These photos are taken at the end of the jetty at the Marina Del Rey break water. I didn't see the Aurora but it was a great sky
