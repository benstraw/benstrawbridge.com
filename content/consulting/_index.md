I've been building software and leading product teams for over two decades now. Started as an engineer at Splunk back when log aggregation was still a novel idea, then helped build what became Apple Music at Beats. These days I split my time between hands-on technical product management and strategic consulting for startups and established companies figuring out their next move.

## What I actually do

The work varies pretty wildly depending on what you need. Sometimes I'm deep in the code helping a fractional CPO role get a React app off the ground with modern AI tools speeding things up. Other times I'm working with founders on customer discovery, trying to figure out if the thing they want to build is the thing people actually need. And sometimes it's just helping teams that are stuck get unstuck.

I spent years at companies like ReliaQuest building AI-powered security tools, at Recharge scaling e-commerce infrastructure that processed millions in transactions, and at Zodaka launching a payment platform from scratch that grew 100% month over month for half a year. The common thread is taking messy problems and turning them into shipping products.

## The technical stuff

Product management without technical chops is just project management with better slides. I can actually read your codebase, debate architecture decisions, and write working code when needed. React and TypeScript are my current go-to for frontend work. Python for backend and data stuff. I've integrated more third party APIs than I can count at this point (Auth0, Stripe, Twilio, Plaid, you name it). I know my way around GCP and AWS well enough to have opinions about when to use which. And I've been leaning hard into AI-assisted development tools like GitHub Copilot and Claude Code because they genuinely make shipping faster.

The security and observability space is where I've spent a lot of recent energy. Built ML-powered field mapping systems, worked on SOC automation, helped teams instrument their apps properly so they can actually see what's breaking and why. This stuff matters more than most companies realize until something goes wrong.

## How I think about product work

Good product management is mostly about asking better questions and making fewer wrong bets. I like working with early design partners to validate ideas before committing serious engineering time. I prefer shipping small things quickly over big things slowly. And I think most product roadmaps would be better if you cut half the features and focused on the ones that actually move the needle.

I've set up agile processes at companies where they had none, but I'm not religious about methodology. Kanban works great until it doesn't. Sprints are useful until they become theater. The goal is shipping valuable stuff, not following a framework perfectly.

## If you need help

Maybe you're a founder with a technical idea but not sure how to validate it or build the first version. Maybe you're a startup that shipped an MVP and now need to scale it without everything falling apart. Maybe you've got a product team that's spinning wheels and you can't figure out why. Or maybe you just need someone who can bridge the gap between what the business wants and what engineering can actually deliver.

I work as a consultant and fractional product leader, which means I can help whether you need someone for a few hours a week or a more involved engagement. Based in Los Angeles but work with teams all over. If you want to talk through what you're working on, reach out at ben@benstrawbridge.com.
