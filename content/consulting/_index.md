## Services

### API Integration projects

Do you have a complex problem that can be solved by pulling data from a wide variety of public and private APIs? Do you need to create a secure and scalable internal or public API? I can help you create the best API integration for the solution you need.

Popular solutions I love working with include -

- [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/core-okta-api/) and [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html),  for securing access to your infrastructure
- [Twillio](https://www.twilio.com/en-us/messaging), [Sendgrid](https://sendgrid.com/en-us) and [Slack](https://api.slack.com/) for all forms of communications
- [Square](https://developer.squareup.com/us/en/case-studies/index) and [Stripe](https://docs.stripe.com/api) for all things commerce, e-commerce and in-person.
- [Plaid](https://plaid.com/docs/) for banking integration and customer verification 
- [postman](https://www.postman.com/) for testing and automating APIs

These are just a few of the APIs I have worked with in the past, I am open to learning and integrating with any API you have in mind.

### Product Management

If you or your business are in the early stage of thinking about creating a digital product and you need help planning from your initial idea through a live production application, then you need a product manager. In the product manager role, I will help plan out all the features you need and ensure your product is complete and well tested.

### Full Stack Application development

Do you already have a product you want to refactor, or a fully formed idea you need to implement? I can help with that too.
